# Cron Triggers - Multi-Schedule System
# 1. Every 5 minutes: Health check + tokens update + 1-minute aggregation
#    - WebSocket health monitoring (Lighter, Paradex, Pacifica, EdgeX)
#    - Updates normalized_tokens table (825 UPSERTs × 12 = 9,900/hour)
#    - Aggregates 15-second snapshots → 1-minute aggregates (data >5min old)
#    - Deletes aggregated 15-second snapshots (reduces DB by ~4×)
# 2. Every hour at minute 0: Hourly aggregation and cleanup
#    - Aggregates 1-minute data → hourly aggregates (data >1h old)
#    - Deletes aggregated 1-minute data (reduces DB by ~60×)
#    - Final compression: 240× reduction (15s → 1h via 1m intermediate)
# 3. V2 Exchange Collection (Separate schedules to avoid timeouts):
#    - 2 * * * *: Binance (581 symbols, slowest)
#    - 7 * * * *: Extended (269 markets)
#    - 12 * * * *: Hyperliquid (190 coins)
#    - 17 * * * *: Lighter (105 markets)
#    - 22 * * * *: Aster (169 markets, variable intervals)
# Cron schedules:
# - */5 * * * *: 5-minute tasks (health check, tokens update, 1m aggregation)
# - 0 * * * *: Hourly aggregation and cleanup
# - 2 * * * *: V2 Binance collection (581 symbols)
# - 7 * * * *: V2 Extended collection (269 markets)
# - 12 * * * *: V2 Hyperliquid collection (190 coins)
# - 17 * * * *: V2 Lighter collection (105 markets)
